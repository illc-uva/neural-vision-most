# Neural Models of the Psychosemantics of 'Most'

This repository accompanites the paper "Neural Models of the Psychosemantics of 'most'": .  It trains neural models of visual 
attention on the experimental paradigm of Pietroski et al 2009, and contains results roughly matching human performance and
a discussion of what to infer from this.

## Requirements

The experiments were run using
- Python 3.5.0
- CUDA 9.0.176 / cuDNN 7.0.5
- TensorFlow 1.8.0

Later versions of the above are likely to work, but your mileage may vary.  The code uses TF's Estimators API, which has changed
somewhat, and could be a source of errors.
